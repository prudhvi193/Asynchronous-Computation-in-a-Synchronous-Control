Assignment-1 (Phase-2)
Program for Asynchrnous Computation in a Synchronous Control

Problem-2) Finding the solution for Probability of P(i) when size of block is adaptive
1)Python NoteBook for Code: Assignment1b_Code.ipynb

2)Execution File generated: Assignment1b_Code.py

3)Command for executing the python file: python Assignment1b_Code.py

4)On executing the command it asks for the input values:
  Arrival Rate: 4
  Service Rate: 10
  
5)Expected Result:
  Graph plotted with the given values where the probability of incoming and the outgoing rates converge to the value of "1.0"


Problem-3) Program for Pseudo Asynchronous Block Processing where each transaction is served immediately once it is arrived into the block
1)Python NoteBook for Code: Assignment1c_Code.ipynb

2)Execution File generated: Assignment1c_Code.py

3)Command for executing the python file: python Assignment1c_Code.py

4)On executing the command it asks for the input values:
  Arrival Rate: 10
  Service Rate: 21
  (Here the block size can vary in the range of (0,âˆž))
  
5)Expected Result:
  Graph plotted with the given values where the probability of incoming and the outgoing rates converge to the value of "1.0"
